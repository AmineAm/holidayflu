# Age-specific metapopulation model of disease spread 
This is the source code for the mathematical model described in the following paper:

Ewing, Anne, Elizabeth C. Lee, Cecile Viboud, and Shweta Bansal. (2016). "Contact, travel, and transmission: The impact of winter holidays on influenza dynamics in the United States." The Journal of Infectious Diseases. doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw642

These Python scripts implement a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered deterministic mathematical model for influenza transmission across U.S. cities among children and adults. In addition to modeling disease transmission, temporary holiday-associated behavioral changes mimicking "school closure" and "travel" may be switched on/off in the model.
