# Age-specific metapopulation model of disease spread 
## Includes holiday-associated behavioral interventions
This is the source code for the mathematical model described in the following paper:

Ewing, Anne, Elizabeth C. Lee, Cecile Viboud, and Shweta Bansal. (2016). "Contact, travel, and transmission: The impact of winter holidays on influenza dynamics in the United States." The Journal of Infectious Diseases. doi:10.1093/infdis/jiw642

These Python scripts implement a mathematical model for influenza transmission across U.S. cities among children and adults.
