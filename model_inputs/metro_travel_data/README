----- SOURCE DATA FILES -----

1) masterairmetrocodes.txt 
	- provided the link between airport codes and MSA populations

	- http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=310&DB_Short_Name=Air%20Carriers

----- DESCRIPTION -----

baseline_flight_network_undirected.txt
- Column 1: Metro area 1
- Column 2: Metro area 2
- Column 3: Average number of passengers that would travel between the two metro areas over a 12 month period at "typical winter travel levels" (based on travel data from January to March 2005)

metro_pop.csv
- parsed from masterairmetrocodes.txt
- metroName is Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or Combined Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA)
- metroNum is numeric metro area identifier in masterairmetrocodes
- pop is population size, the data were compared to reported population sizes for a handful of MSAs and it appears that these data pre-date the 2000 Census.

----- ADDITIONAL NOTES -----

- self-loops (travel between the same airport) were removed
- airports outside of metro areas listed in masterairmetrocodes.txt were removed
- "average number of passengers over a 12 month period" was calculated as average number of passengers in a given month * 12
- filenames ending in "_spaces" should be space-delimited
- other files should be tab-delimited
